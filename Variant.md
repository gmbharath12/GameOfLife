In the provided code, the check `board[x][y] == 2` in the `countNeighbors` function is used to count both live and dying cells as neighbors. Let's break down why this check is necessary and how it fits into the overall logic of Conway's Game of Life.

### Understanding the Purpose:

1. **Board State Representation:**
   - In Conway's Game of Life, cells can be in one of two states: alive (`1`) or dead (`0`). Additionally, your code uses `2` and `3` as temporary states to mark cells that are dying or being born in the current iteration, respectively.

2. **Counting Neighbors:**
   - The `countNeighbors` function is designed to count the number of live neighbors around a given cell `(i, j)` on the board. Live neighbors are cells that are currently `1` (alive).

3. **Including Dying Cells:**
   - During the evaluation of neighbors, cells marked as `2` (dying) are also considered as part of the neighborhood count. This is because in Conway's rules, a dying cell in the current iteration might influence the fate of neighboring cells in the next iteration.

### Why Check `board[x][y] == 2`?

- **Influence on Neighbors:**
  - When counting neighbors for a cell `(i, j)`, the state of neighboring cells matters because it affects the rules for whether a cell should live, die, or be born in the next generation.
  - Cells marked as `2` (dying) are cells that were alive in the previous state but are marked to die in the current iteration. Despite being marked for death (`2`), they are still considered influential on the current state of the board and thus counted as neighbors.

- **Consistent Evaluation:**
  - Including `board[x][y] == 2` ensures that the counting function correctly evaluates the total influence of both currently live cells (`1`) and cells that are transitioning to death (`2`) on the current cell's fate.

### Example Scenario:

- Imagine a scenario where a live cell `(i, j)` has two live neighbors (`1`) and one dying neighbor (`2`). According to the rules of Conway's Game of Life:
  - The live cell `(i, j)` would typically survive to the next generation if it has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors.
  - Including the dying neighbor (`2`) in the count ensures that the function accurately reflects the environment around the cell `(i, j)` and makes the correct decision on whether it survives or dies in the next iteration.

### Conclusion:

The check `board[x][y] == 2` in `countNeighbors` is necessary to accurately count the number of live neighbors (cells currently `1`) and dying neighbors (cells marked `2`) around a given cell `(i, j)`. This ensures that the game's rules are applied correctly, determining the state of each cell in the next generation based on its immediate environment.
