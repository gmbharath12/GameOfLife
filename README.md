The Game of Life

Leetcode 289:

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]

Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

Taken from Leetcode ignore:

If the board becomes infinitely large, there are multiple problems our current solution would run into:

It would be computationally impossible to iterate a matrix that large.
It would not be possible to store that big a matrix entirely in memory. We have huge memory capacities these days i.e. of the order of hundreds of GBs. However, it still wouldn't be enough to store such a large matrix in memory.
We would be wasting a lot of space if such a huge board only has a few live cells and the rest of them are all dead. In such a case, we have an extremely sparse matrix and it wouldn't make sense to save the board as a "matrix".
